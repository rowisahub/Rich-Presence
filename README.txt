For this to work you need NodeJS installed on your system. https://nodejs.org/en/

Next make sure your logged in to a account

then you can run it with the 'Start.bat' file or you can open a CMD promt and do 'node .'


If you get a Error saying 'illegal access' thats means that, the machine you are running this script from doesn't have access to that/your account

also make sure to change around the './data/conf/info.json' to what you want
